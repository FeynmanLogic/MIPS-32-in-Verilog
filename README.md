# MIPS-32-in-Verilog
This is my implementation in understanding MIPS-32 ISA, and the underlying architecture. I used Verilog to implement a pipeline, along with some of the instructions in the MIPS ISA.
I have provied ample documentation within the code for someone to understand the underlying motivation behind a particular line.
<b>The motivation is getting a proper feel of the process of processor design and pipelining.</b>
